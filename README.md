Description : 

This POC demonstrates the understanding of react hooks, custom hooks, callbacks, "this" binding, component based architecture.
Each major task as given in problem statement is made with separate component to make the scalable code.

I have also tried my level best to make re-usable code with dependency injection.

This POC can also be made with Web Workers API in which we can define each worker for each test task but it will then 
require more time and some research as javascript is single threaded unlike java which is multithreaded in which we can create pool of threads for increasing number of tasks.

Please let me know if anything else needed from my end. I will be quite happy to discuss over this POC.
